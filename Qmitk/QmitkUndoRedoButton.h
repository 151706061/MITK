/*!
 * \brief A Qt widget for undo/redo, which is able to listen to MITK undo models.
 *
 * This widget provides a Word-like undo button, which can either undo only the last 
 * action (simple click on the button) or display the undo history to the user 
 * (click on arrow) so multiple actions can be undone in one step.
 *
 * A property m_Mode is inherited from QUndoRedoButton, which can be either "Undo" or "Redo".
 * Depending on this mode, differenct functions of the associated undo model are called.

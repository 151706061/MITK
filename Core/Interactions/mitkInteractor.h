//## @brief Interface for an Interactor.
//## @ingroup Interaction
//## The Interactor is held with a SmartPointer by a DataTreeNode 
//## and holds its Node with a Pointer. That way Smartpointer doesn't build a circle.
//## Different Modes: In order to work with hierarchical StateMachines and not to send Events to all StateMachines, a StateMachine can be 
//## in three different modes: 
//## DESELECTED: this statemachine doesn't wait for an event
//## SELECTED: this statemachine just has handled an event and waits for the next one
//## SUBSELECTED: a hierarchical lower statemachine has just handled an event so this statemachine wants to pass the event to this machine
//## Guidelines for the modevalues: Selected if the coresponding data is selected, deselected if deselect of data, 
//## subselect if a subobject is selected (and a submachine is selected).
//## Set the mode in each hierachical lavel of a statemachine! Each statemachine has to to this on its own in ExecuteAction, cause only here 
//## can be recognized if a substatemachine has to be selected or this statemachine has to be selected.
//##
//## In moving the machine is selected. After a new insert the machine is selected, since the data is also selected
//## In method ExecuteAction(..) the different actions are divided up through switch/case statements. Each block has to check
//## the appropriate type of event to process the actions. Especially in guarding states (a state, that checks certain conditions (e.g. is picked)
//## the according Event must be called to continue in states. No return false here!

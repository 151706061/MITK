\section OverlaysPage_Introduction Overlays and Annotations

The overlays in MITK are a simple way to display additional information on the render windows. A class, deriving from mitk::Overlay represents an arbitrary
2D or 3D object that can be rendered as an overlay. This can for example be used for the annotation of 3D points or to overlay despriptions in the window corners.
The mitk::OverlayManager is used to add the overlays to the renderwindows, updating them and manage the respective layout managers.
The following features are implemented in this framework.
<ol>
  <li>Definition of graphical elements that can be displayed in the render windows.
  <li>It is possible to manage multiple elements in each window.
  <li>A single Overlay can be rendered on any number of available render windows.
  <li>2D and 3D textelements are already defined in the Overlay module and are using VTK to create custom annotations.
  <li>The mitk::BaseLayouter interface enables the implementation of layout managers, to handle the placement of the overlays.
</ol>

The mitk::Overlay can be implemented using a custom rendering framework like VTK. In this diagram, the vtkOverlay is shown as the superclass for all Overlays which use the vtk framework for rendering.
The OverlayManager is a microservice that can be registered to several BaseRenderer instances in order to call the update method of each Overlay during the rendering phase of the renderer.
It also manages the respective Layouters which are used to manage the placement of a group of Overlays.

\subsection OverlaysPage_OverlayManagerSubsection OverlayManager

The mitk::OverlayManager is the manager for a set of Overlays and the respective Layouters. It is implemented as a microservice that can be instanciated multiple times.
Before the manager can be used, all mitk::BaseRenderer have to be registered to the mitk::OverlayManager instance like this:

\code
m_OverlayManager = mitk::OverlayManager::New();
mitk::BaseRenderer* axialRenderer = mitk::BaseRenderer::GetInstance(this->GetRenderWindowPart()->GetRenderWindow("axial")->GetRenderWindow());
axialRenderer->SetOverlayManager(m_OverlayManager);
\endcode

The mitk::OverlayManager can then be used anywhere in the program by fetching it as follows:

\code
//The id that is passed identifies the correct mitk::OverlayManager and is '0' by default.
mitk::OverlayManager::Pointer overlayManager = mitk::OverlayManager::GetServiceInstance(0);
\endcode

All mitk::Overlay instances can now be added to the OverlayManager by calling mitk::OverlayManager::AddOverlay.

\subsection OverlaysPage_LayouterSubsection Layouter

In order to use Layouters for the positioning
of the Overlays, each Layouter object that has been created has to be added to an internal list in the OverlayManager:

\code
//fetch the renderer for that the Layouter will be used.
mitk::BaseRenderer* axialRenderer = mitk::BaseRenderer::GetInstance(this->GetRenderWindowPart()->GetRenderWindow("axial")->GetRenderWindow());

//This creates a 2DLayouter that is only active for the recently fetched axialRenderer and positione
mitk::Overlay2DLayouter::Pointer layouter2D mitk::Overlay2DLayouter::CreateLayouter(mitk::Overlay2DLayouter::STANDARD_2D_TOPLEFT, axialRenderer)

//Now, the created Layouter is added to the OverlayManager and can be referred to by its identification string.
overlayManager->AddLayouter(layouter2D.GetPointer());

//Several other Layouters can be added to the overlayManager
mitk::Overlay2DLayouter::Pointer layouter2D mitk::Overlay2DLayouter::CreateLayouter(mitk::Overlay2DLayouter::STANDARD_2D_BOTTOM, axialRenderer)
overlayManager->AddLayouter(layouter2D.GetPointer());
\endcode

The mitk::OverlayManager::SetLayouter method can then be used to configure an Overlay to be positioned by a certain Layouter:

\code
//Because a Layouter is specified by the identification string AND the Renderer, both have to be passed to the call.
overlayManager->SetLayouter(textOverlay.GetPointer(),mitk::Overlay2DLayouter::STANDARD_2D_TOPLEFT,axialRenderer);
\endcode

\section OverlaysPage_UsageSection Usage of Predefined Overlays

\subsection OverlaysPage_TextWidget2DUsageSubsection mitkTextOverlay2D
This exemplary overlay can render UTF-8 encoded text as a 2D Overlay. The Overlay2DLayouter can be used to automatically place a group of overlays to a
specific corner.
\code
//The BaseRenderer is only needed to set a layouter
mitk::BaseRenderer* axialRenderer = mitk::BaseRenderer::GetInstance(this->GetRenderWindowPart()->GetRenderWindow("axial")->GetRenderWindow());

//This fetches an instance of the OverlayManager microservice
mitk::OverlayManager::Pointer overlayManager = mitk::OverlayManager::GetServiceInstance(0);

//Create a textOverlay2D
mitk::TextOverlay2D::Pointer textOverlay = mitk::TextOverlay2D::New();

textOverlay->SetText("Test!"); //set UTF-8 encoded text to render
textOverlay->SetFontSize(40);
textOverlay->SetColor(1,0,0); //Set text color to red
textOverlay->SetOpacity(1);

//The position of the Overlay can be set to a fixed coordinate on the display.
mitk::Point2D pos;
pos[0] = 10,pos[1] = 20;
textOverlay->SetPosition2D(pos);

//Add the overlay to the overlayManager. It is added to all registered renderers automaticly
overlayManager->AddOverlay(textOverlay.GetPointer());

//Alternatively, a layouter can be used to manage the position of the overlay. If a layouter is set, the absolute position of the overlay is not used anymore
//The Standard TopLeft Layouter has to be registered to the OverlayManager first
overlayManager->AddLayouter(mitk::Overlay2DLayouter::CreateLayouter(mitk::Overlay2DLayouter::STANDARD_2D_TOPLEFT, renderer).GetPointer());

//Set a Layouter to the overlay by using this method and pass the identifier of the previously registered Layouter.
overlayManager->SetLayouter(textOverlay.GetPointer(),mitk::Overlay2DLayouter::STANDARD_2D_TOPLEFT,axialRenderer);

\endcode

\subsection OverlaysPage_TextWidget3DUsageSubsection mitkTextOverlay3D
This overlay displays labels in 3D coordinates. The labels always face the camera.
\code
//This fetches an instance of the OverlayManager microservice.
mitk::OverlayManager::Pointer overlayManager = mitk::OverlayManager::GetServiceInstance(0);

mitk::PointSet::Pointer pointset = mitk::PointSet::New();

// This vector is used to define an offset for the annotations, in order to show them with a margin to the actual coordinate.
mitk::Point3D offset;
offset[0] = .5;
offset[1] = .5;
offset[2] = .5;

//Just a loop to create some points
for(int i=0 ; i < 10 ; i++){
    //To each point, a TextOverlay3D is created
    mitk::TextOverlay3D::Pointer textOverlay3D = mitk::TextOverlay3D::New();
    mitk::Point3D point;
    point[0] = i*20;
    point[1] = i*30;
    point[2] = -i*50;
    pointset->InsertPoint(i, point);
    textOverlay3D->SetText("A Point");

    // The Position is set to the point coordinate to create an annotation to the point in the PointSet.
    textOverlay3D->SetPosition3D(point);

    // move the annotation away from the actual point
    textOverlay3D->SetOffsetVector(offset);

    overlayManager->AddOverlay(textOverlay3D.GetPointer());
}

// also show the created pointset
mitk::DataNode::Pointer datanode = mitk::DataNode::New();
datanode->SetData(pointset);
datanode->SetName("pointSet");
GetDataStorage()->Add(datanode);
\endcode

\subsection OverlaysPage_NotManagedSubsection Manually Managed Overlays
In order to integrate an Overlay into an mitk::Mapper, it is advised not to use the OverlayManager but to manually manage the Overlay.
To do so, the update methods of the overlays have to be called manually before the start of each rendering procedure. It must only be called if the Properties have changed or if your custom overlay implements its own rendering mechanism.

\section OverlaysPage_CustomOverlaySection Implement a Custom Overlay

A new custom Overlay should derive from mitkOverlay or one of the later mentioned subclasses VtkOverlay2D oder VtkOverlay3D. There should always be an implementation for the methods
AddOverlay, RemoveOverlay and Update Overlay.
UpdateOverlay is the procedure that is called in each rendering step. If the Overlay is rendered by VTK, this method only applies the properties to the representation.
If the custom Overlay requires additional properties, they should be made accessible by getters and setters for a better usability:
\code
void mitk::VtkOverlay3D::SetPosition3D(Point3D position3D, mitk::BaseRenderer *renderer)
{
  mitk::Point3dProperty::Pointer position3dProperty = mitk::Point3dProperty::New(position3D);
  SetProperty("Position3D", position3dProperty,renderer);
}

mitk::Point3D mitk::VtkOverlay3D::GetPosition3D(mitk::BaseRenderer *renderer)
{
  mitk::Point3D position3D;
  GetPropertyValue<mitk::Point3D>("Position3D", position3D, renderer);
  return position3D;
}
\endcode

\subsection OverlaysPage_CustomVTK2DOverlaySubsection VTK 2D Overlay

VTK based overlays which are meant to be displayed in 2D over the render window should derive from the mitk::VtkOverlay2D.
The mitk::VtkOverlay2D is a subclass of Vtk::Overlay, that uses VTK to render the overlay. This class creates the Overlay representation as a vtkActor2D, and is very easy to implement
because only UpdateVtkOverlay2D and GetVtkActor2D have to be implemented. The add, update and remove methods are implemented in the superclasses.
UpdateVtkOverlay2D only needs to apply the specific properties and GetVtkActor2D simply returns the created vtkActor.

\subsection OverlaysPage_CustomVTK3DOverlaySubsection VTK 3D Overlay

The mitkVtkOverlay3D works just like mitkVtkOverlay2D, but it is designed for arbitrary 3D objects which derive from vtkProp,

\section OverlaysPage_CustomLayouterSection Implement a Custom Layouter

A Layouter is used for an automatic positioning of a group of Overlays and is derived from mitkBaseLayouter. Every Layouter that manages a group of Layouts should have a unique identifier
which is used to register the Layouter in the OverlayManager. A Layouter is always uniquely defined by the identifier and one BaseRenderer. Before a Layouter can be used by the
OverlayManager it has to be added, using the AddLayouter Method. An Overlay can then be added to a Layout as follows:

\code
overlayManager->SetLayouter(textOverlay.GetPointer(),mitk::Overlay2DLayouter::STANDARD_2D_TOPLEFT,axialRenderer);
\endcode

A new Layouter has to implement PrepareLayout which should parse the internal Overlay list and set their position as required.

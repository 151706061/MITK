* @brief This abstract class gives a meaningful default implementations to most methods of mitkIFileWriter.h.
*
* In general, all FileWriters should derive from this class, this way it is made sure that the new implementation is
* exposed to the Microservice-Framework and that is automatically available troughout MITK.
* The default implementation only requires the two write
* methods and the Clone() method to be implemented. Be sure to set all important members in the constructor. These are:
* <ul>
*  <li> m_Extension: To define which file extension can be written.
*  <li> m_Description: To give a human readable name for this writer to be displayed in FileDialogs.
*  <li> m_BasedataType: To define which type of Basedata this fileWriter can handle.
*  <li> (Optional) m_Priority: To make this writer rank higher when choosing writers automatically
*  <li> (Optional) m_SupportedOptions: To define which options this writer can handle. Options can modify writing behaviour (e.g. set a compression)
* </ul>
* You can also use the protected constructor for this.

\section one Get a source tree

Since MITK is under active development we recommend to use subversion to get
the most recent version. To make sure you get a stable tree, check the <a
href="http://public.kitware.com/MITK/Dashboard/MostRecentResults-Nightly/Dashboard.html">MITK
dashboard</a> at Kitware before checking out. If the build tree is not clean, you can specify an older revision for the checkout or get a stable tar ball from <a href="http://www.mitk.org">mitk.org</a>

To checkout MITK's current subversion repository do:

<tt>
svn co svn://mbi.dkfz-heidelberg.de/mitkExt/trunk/mitk mitk
</tt>

If you prefer a graphical client (look <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html#clients">here [subversion.tigris.org]</a> for a list), use <tt>svn://mbi.dkfz-heidelberg.de/mitkExt/trunk/mitk</tt> as the repository URL for the trunk.

\section two Build MITK with CMake 

Create a new directory for the binary tree, change to it and call CMake:

<tt>
mkdir mitkBinary<br>
cd mitkBinary<br>
ccmake ../mitk</tt> (assuming you are still in the directory you did the checkout in<br>
<tt>make<br>
</tt>

If you use Windows, then you just start the CMake GUI and enter the location of the source and of the binary tree. 
CMake will create a Visual Studio solution in the root of your binary tree.

\note "Installing" MITK via cmake (or using "make install") is not yet supported. You can find the application in <tt>&lt;binary_dir&gt;/mitk/bin</tt> and the libraries in <tt>&lt;binary_dir&gt;/mitk/lib</tt>.

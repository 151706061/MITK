 \page Step3Page Step 3 - Create 3D view
 
As in the previous step one or more data sets (many images, surface and other formats) may be loaded. The difference is that they are displayed in a 3D view.
The QmitkRenderWindow is now used for displaying a 3D view, by setting the used mapper-slot to Standard3D. 
Since volume-rendering is a (rather) slow procedure, the default is that images are not displayed in the 3D view.\n
In Step 3a the default is kept whereas in Step 3b volume rendering is turned on.


\li \ref Step3.cpp "Step3.cpp"\n 
Contains the code that both creates a 3D view and turns volume rendering on.


\section Step3aSection Step 3a - Volume rendering turned off
  
\image html step3a_result.png 
  
\dontinclude Step3.cpp

Tell the renderer to create a 3D view:
 
\skipline // use it as a 3D view!
\skipline renderWindow.GetRenderer()->SetMapperID

The rest of the code remains unchanged.\n
The picture above shows the result of the program when reading both the image and the surface file.
As volume rendering is off the image is not visible.
 
\section Step3bSection Step 3b - Volume rendering turned on
 
\image html step3b_result.png 
 
Volume Rendering is now turned on as shown in the picture above.\n
\dontinclude Step3.cpp 
The property "volumerendering" has to be turned on on the node containing the image.
 
\skipline Check

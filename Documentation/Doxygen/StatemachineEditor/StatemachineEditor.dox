\section StatemachineEditorOverview Overview

This plug-in for Eclipse allows you to create new statemachines and change existing statemachines in an graphical editor. You can open existing
statemachines from a xml file or create a new statemachine in a new xml file.

This document will tell you how to install the plug-in for eclipse and how to use it.

\section StatemachineEditorInstallation How to Install the Statemachine-Editor

First of all you have to install Eclipse (Eclipse Classic) and the plug-in Graphical Editing Framework (GEF). Furthermore we need the packages JDOM
(jdom.jar) and Java3D (vecmath.jar).

Now you have to unzip the file StateMachines.zip into your eclipse folder. The file is located in your SVN checkout mitk/core/interactions.

Start Eclipse and select "File" -> "Import...".

\image html Import.PNG "\b Fig.1: Import"

In the popup window (\b Fig.1: Import) select the folder "Plug-in Development" and "Plug-ins and Fragments".

\image html Import2.PNG "\b Fig.2: Selection"

On the page "Selection" (\b Fig.2: Selection) select the "StateMachines (1.0.0) Plug-in.

\image html Import3.PNG "\b Fig.3: Selection 2"

Click the "Add ->" button (\b Fig.3: Selection 2).

\image html Import4.PNG "\b Fig.4: Selection 3"

Click "Finish" (\b Fig.4: Selection 3).

Now you have to make sure that the path to vecmath.jar and jdom.jar is set correctly.

\image html BuildPath.PNG "\b Fig.5: Set Build Path"

You can find the build path by selecting the project in the package view and the go to "Project" -> "Properties" -> "Java Build Path" in the tab
"Libraries" (as you can see in \b Fig.5: Set Build Path).

Now you should be able to start a Run-time Workbench.

\image html Eclipse1.png "\b Fig.6: Start Run-time Workbench"

Therefore you have to press the "Run" button and select "Eclipse Application", Click "OK" (\b Fig.6: Start Run-time Workbench).

A new Eclipse workbench opens where we can use the Statemachine-Editor.


\section StatemachineEditorManual How to use the Statemachine-Editor

In the Eclipse Run-time Workbench we have to create a new Java project first (\b Fig.7: Create a new Java project).

\image html CreateJavaProject.PNG "\b Fig.7: Create a new Java project"

Then you can select one of the two buttons:

\li "New statemachine"
\li "Statemachines from *.xml"


\subsection StatemachineEditorManual1 New Statemachines

When you press the button "New Statemachine" the following window will pop up:

\image html NewStatemachine.PNG "\b Fig.8: New Statemachine"

Here, you have to "Browse..." for your Java-Project as your file container (\b Fig.8: New Statemachine).

\image html NewStatemachine1.PNG "\b Fig.9: New Statemachine 1"

Select your Project and click "OK" (Fig.9: New Statemachine 1).

\image html NewStatemachine2.PNG "\b Fig.10: New Statemachine 2"

As soon as you have selected a container and a File name, the "Finish" button will become enabled (\b Fig.10: New Statemachine 2).

\b Attention: If the filename has already been used, you have to set another filename to enable the "Finish" button.

\image html NewStatemachine3.PNG "\b Fig.11: New Statemachine 3"

As a last step you have to enter the location and name for the xml file to be generated (\b Fig.11: New Statemachine 3).

\subsection StatemachineEditorManual3 Work with the Editor

Now your workspace looks something like this:

\image html application.PNG "\b Fig.12: Workspace"

You can open a statemachine from the "Statemachines List" view (\b Fig.12: Workspace) by performing a double click on the statemachine.
The an editor opens and on its palette you can find all tools, such as create state or create transition.

\image html openPropertiesView.PNG "\b Fig.13: Open the properties view"

\image html application1.PNG "\b Fig.14: Change statename in the properties view"

To edit the statename or state ID you have to open the "Properties" view (\b Fig.14: Change statename in the properties view). You will get it by
"Window"->"Show View" -> "Other..." -> "General" -> "Properties" (\b Fig.13: Open the properties view).

\image html changeEvent.PNG "\b Fig.15: Change Event"

\image html addAction.PNG "\b Fig.16: Add Action"

To change a transitions event or action you have to select the transition and open its context menu (\b Fig.15: Change Event, \b Fig.16: Add Action).
You can connect a transition to another state by drag one end of it and drop it to another state. All these changes are connected with an undo/redo 
controller.

When you save your statemachine it will be saved as an xml file which you either have created with your new statemachine or have opened before.

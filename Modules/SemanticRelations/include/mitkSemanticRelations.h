  * @brief  The API provides functions to query and manipulate image relations and instances,
  *         that are helpful during follow-up examination, like control-points (time period),
  *         types of the images or lesions that may be visible on multiple images.
  *
  *   The class is able to generate IDs from given data nodes using DICOM information.
  *   These IDs are used to identify the corresponding instances of a specific case.
  *   The case can also be directly identified by the given case ID.
  *
  *   In the BlackSwan context the case is identified with the DICOM PatientID.
  *
  *   In order for most functions to work the case ID has to be defined in the model. If not,
  *   the functions do nothing.

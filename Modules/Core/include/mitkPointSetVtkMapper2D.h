  /**
  * @brief Vtk-based 2D mapper for PointSet
  *
  * Due to the need of different colors for selected
  * and unselected points and the facts, that we also have a contour and
  * labels for the points, the vtk structure is build up the following way:
  *
  * We have three PolyData, one selected, and one unselected and one
  * for a contour between the points. Each one is connected to an own
  * PolyDataMapper and an Actor. The different color for the unselected and
  * selected state and for the contour is read from properties.
  *
  * This mapper has several additional functionalities, such as rendering
  * a contour between points, calculating and displaying distances or angles
  * between points.
  *
  * @section mitkPointSetVtkMapper2D_point_rep Point Representation
  *
  * The points are displayed as small glyphs of configurable shape
  * (see property "PointSet.2D.shape"). The size of these glyphs
  * is given in world units. That means, the size or shape of those
  * glyphs is independent of the BaseGeometry object that you assign
  * to the PointSet. As for all other objects, _positions_ of points
  * will be transformed into the world via the Geometry's index-to-world
  * transform.
  *
  * Then the three Actors are combined inside a vtkPropAssembly and this
  * object is returned in GetProp() and so hooked up into the rendering
  * pipeline.
  *
  * @section mitkPointSetVtkMapper2D_propertires Applicable Properties
  *
  * Properties that can be set for point sets and influence the PointSetVTKMapper2D are:
  *
  *   - \b "line width": (IntProperty 2)                      // line width of the line from one point to another
  *   - \b "point line width": (IntProperty 1)                // line width of the cross marking a point
  *   - \b "point 2D size": (FloatProperty 6)                 // size of the glyph marking a point (diameter, in world
  * units!)
  *   - \b "show contour": (BoolProperty false)               // enable contour rendering between points (lines)
  *   - \b "close contour": (BoolProperty false)              // if enabled, the open strip is closed (first point
  * connected with last point)
  *   - \b "show points": (BoolProperty true)                 // show or hide points
  *   - \b "show distances": (BoolProperty false)             // show or hide distance measure
  *   - \b "distance decimal digits": (IntProperty 2)         // set the number of decimal digits to be shown when
  * rendering the distance information
  *   - \b "show angles": (BoolProperty false)                // show or hide angle measurement
  *   - \b "show distant lines": (BoolProperty false)         // show the line between to points from a distant view
  * (equals "always on top" option)
  *   - \b "layer": (IntProperty 1)                           // default is drawing pointset above images (they have a
  * default layer of 0)
  *   - \b "PointSet.2D.shape" (EnumerationProperty Cross)    // provides different shapes marking a point
  *       0 = "None", 1 = "Vertex", 2 = "Dash", 3 = "Cross", 4 = "ThickCross", 5 = "Triangle", 6 = "Square", 7 =
  * "Circle",
  *       8 = "Diamond", 9 = "Arrow", 10 = "ThickArrow", 11 = "HookedArrow", 12 = "Cross"
  *   - \b "PointSet.2D.fill shape": (BoolProperty false)     // fill or do not fill the glyph shape
  *   - \b "Pointset.2D.distance to plane": (FloatProperty 4.0) //In the 2D render window, points are rendered which lie
  * within a certain distance
  *                                                             to the current plane. They are projected on the current
  * plane and scaled according to their distance.
  *                                                             Point markers appear smaller as the plane moves away
  * from
  * their true location.
  *                                                             The distance threshold can be adjusted by this float
  * property, which ables the user to delineate the points
  *                                                             that lie exactly on the plane. (+/- rounding error)
  *
  * Other Properties used here but not defined in this class:
  *
  *   - \b "selectedcolor": (ColorProperty (1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f))  // default color of the selected pointset e.g. the
  * current
  * point is red
  *   - \b "contourcolor" : (ColorProperty (1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f))  // default color for the contour is red
  *   - \b "color": (ColorProperty (1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f))          // default color of the (unselected) pointset is yellow
  *   - \b "opacity": (FloatProperty 1.0)                       // opacity of point set, contours
  *   - \b "label": (StringProperty nullptr)     // a label can be defined for each point, which is rendered in proximity
  * to
  * the point
  *

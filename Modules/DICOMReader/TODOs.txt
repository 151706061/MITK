Important

[ ] ONLY load a pre-sorted list
[ ] Either NRRD cache option or slice-by-slice loading
[x] Performance of mitkdump / DICOMReaderSelector (TagCache?)
    - the note in GDCM..Reader::GetTagValue() is correct.
      This piece of code is taking lots of time.
      Approx. half of the time is tag scanning, the other
      half is construction of block describing properties,
      which accesses GetTagValue.
[x]   - maybe we can evaluate these properties in a lazy way
        (only when asked for).
        Solution: Yes, this helps, implemented.
[x] Sorting by "Image Time" seems undeterministic (clarkson test data)
[x] - Numeric conversion of "1.2.3.4" yields 1.2 on Windows, seems to fail on Linux(?)
      - need to verify that the whole string (except whitespace at the begin/end) was converted
        Solution: GetTagValue as String does a right-trim plus we check after conversion! Works.
[ ] Implement Configurator::GetBuiltIn3DReaders() (don't ignore "classic reader")
[ ] Complete MITK properties of images: level/window and color type (MONOCHROME1/2)
[ ] Check input images fo DICOMness and non-multi-frameness
[ ] Use CanReadFile() in selection!
[ ] Check TODO in mitkDICOMTag.cpp
[ ] Configurable precision for tag value comparisons
[x] Images are upside-down in some cases
    - error was hidden assumption somewhere: filenames for ImageSeriesReader need
      to be in an order that goes along the image normals, not in the opposite
      direction

Questionable

[ ] Fallback to filename instead of instance UID?

Nice-to-have

[ ] Multi-Frame images (DCMTK)
[ ] ...

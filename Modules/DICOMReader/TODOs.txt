[ ] Either NRRD cache option or slice-by-slice loading
[ ] Performance of mitkdump / DICOMReaderSelector (TagCache?)
[?] Sorting by "Image Time" seems undeterministic (clarkson test data)
    - seems deterministic on Linux, needs test on Windows
[ ] Fallback to filename instead of instance UID?
[ ] Implement Configurator::GetBuiltIn3DReaders() (don't ignore "classic reader")
[ ] Complete MITK properties of images: level/window and color type (MONOCHROME1/2)
[ ] Multi-Frame images (DCMTK)
[ ] Check input images fo DICOMness and non-multi-frameness
[ ] Use CanReadFile() in selection!
[ ] Check TODO in mitkDICOMTag.cpp
[ ] Configurable precision for tag value comparisons
[x] Images are upside-down in some cases
    - error was hidden assumption somewhere: filenames for ImageSeriesReader need
      to be in an order that goes along the image normals, not in the opposite
      direction

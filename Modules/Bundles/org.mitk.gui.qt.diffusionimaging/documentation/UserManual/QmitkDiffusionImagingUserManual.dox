\bundlemainpage{org.diffusion} MITK Diffusion Imaging (MITK-DI)

This module provides means to diffusion weighted image reconstruction, visualization and quantification. Diffusion tensors are supported as well as different q-ball reconstruction schemes are supported. Q-ball imaging aims at recovering more detailed information about the orientations of fibers from diffusion MRI measurements and, in particular, to resolve the orientations of crossing fibers.

\section QmitkDiffusionImagingUserManualIssues Known Issues

\li <b>Dicom Import:</b> The dicom import does not cover all hardware manufacturers. In fact, it has only been thoroughly tested with Siemens dicom images. MITK-DI is also capable of reading the nrrd format, which is documented elsewhere [1, 2]. These files can be created by combining the raw image data with a corresponding textual header file. The file extension should be changed from *.nrrd to *.dwi or from *.nhdr to *.hdwi respectively in order to let MITK-DI recognize the diffusion related header information provided in the files.

\section QmitkDiffusionImagingUserManualTensorReconstruction Tensor Reconstruction

The tensor reconstruction view allows ITK based tensor reconstruction [3].

The advanced settings for ITK reconstruction let you configure the number of threads to be used and a manual threshold on the non-diffusion weighted image. All voxels below this threshold will not be reconstructed and left blank.

A few seconds (depending on the image size) after the reconstruction button is hit, a colored image should appear in the main window.

\section QmitkDiffusionImagingUserManualQBallReconstruction Q-Ball Reconstruction

The q-ball reonstruction bundle implements a variety of reconstruction methods. The button "Average redundant gradients" accumulates the information that was acquired with multiple repetitions for one gradient. Vectors do not have to be precisely equal in order to be merged, if a "Merge radius" > 0 is configured.

The different reconstruction methods are described in the following:
\li <b>Numerical:</b> The original, numerical q-ball reconstruction presented by Tuch et al. [5]
\li <b>Standard (SH):</b> Descoteaux's reconstruction based on spherical harmonic basis functions [6]
\li <b>Solid Angle (SH):</b> Aganj's reconstruction with solid angle consideration [7]
\li <b>ADC-profile only:</b> The ADC-profile reconstructed with spherical harmonic basis functions
\li <b>Raw signal only:</b> The raw signal reconstructed with spherical harmonic basis functions

Please recognize the tooltips in the advanced settings box. B0 threshold works the same as in tensor reconstruction. The maximum l-level configures the size of the spherical harmonics basis. Larger l-values (e.g. l=8) allow higher levels of detail, lower levels are more stable against noise (e.g. l=4). Lambda is a regularisation parameter. Set it to 0 for no regularisation. lambda = 0.006 has proven to be a stable choice under various settings. The multi lambda option lets you reconstruct different volumes with different lambdas with one click.

This is how a q-ball image should initially look after reconstruction. Standard q-balls feature a relatively low GFA and thus appear rather dark. Adjust the level-window to solve this.

\section QmitkDiffusionImagingUserManualDicomImport Dicom Import

The dicom import does not cover all hardware manufacturers. In fact, it has only been thoroughly tested with Siemens dicom images. MITK-DI is also capable of reading the nrrd format, which is documented elsewhere [1, 2]. These files can be created by combining the raw image data with a corresponding textual header file. The file extension should be changed from *.nrrd to *.dwi or from *.nhdr to *.hdwi respectively in order to let MITK-DI recognize the diffusion related header information provided in the files.

In case your dicom images are readable by MITK-DI, select one or more input dicom folders and click import.

The advanced settings control some import options. "Use series details" and "Consider acquisition number" tell the algorithms, if series related information in the dicom header should be used to tell appart different image volumes. "Recursive" digs into the selected folders recursively. "Avg. dupl. grad." does the same as the corresponding "Average redundant gradients" in the q-ball reconstruction view (refer to the corresponding help section for details).

The quantification view allows the derivation of different scalar anisotropy measures for the reconstructed tensors (FA and RA) or q-balls (GFA).

\section QmitkDiffusionImagingUserManualVisualizationSettings ODF Visualization Setting

In this small view, the visualization of ODFs and diffusion images can be configured. Depending on the selected image in the data storage, different options are shown here.

For a tensor or q-ball image, the third button from the left is of importance - it toggles the visibility of the glyphs. The spin box to its right lets you configer the number of glyphs that should maximaly be displayed. This is usefull to keep the system response time during rendering feasible. The other options configure normalization and scaling of the glyphs.

In diffusion images, a slider lets you choose the desired image channel from the vector of images (each gradient direction one image) for rendering. Furthermore reinit can be performed and texture interpolation toggled.

This is how a visualization with activated glyphs should look like:

\section QmitkBasicImageProcessingUserManualOverview Overview

This module allows has been designed to provide an easy interface to fundamental image preprocessing and image enhancement filters.
It provides a variety of image operations in the areas of noise suppression, morphological operations, edge detection and image arithmetics.
In the moment, the module can handle all 3D and 4D image types loadable by MITK. 2D image support will be added in the future. 
All offered filters are encapsulated from the ITK toolkit (www.itk.org).

This document will tell you how to use this functionality, but it is assumed that you already know how to use MITK in general.

\section QmitkBasicImageProcessingUserManualFilters Filters

This section will not describe the fundamental functioning of the single filters in detail, though.
If you want to know more about a single filter, please have a look at http://www.itk.org/Doxygen316/html/classes.html 
or in any good digital image processing book.

Available filters are:

<H1>\a Single image operations</H1>

<ul>
<li> <b>Noise Suppression</b>
  <ul>
  <li> Gaussian Denoising
  <li> Median Filtering
  <li> Total Variation Denoising
  </ul>
  
<li> <b>Morphological Operations</b>
  <ul>
  <li> Dilation
  <li> Erosion
  <li> Opening
  <li> Closing
  </ul>
  
<li> <b>Edge Detection</b>
  <ul>
  <li> Gradient Image
  <li> Laplacian Operator (Second Derivative)
  <li> Sobel Operator
  </ul>
  
<li> <b>Other</b>
  <ul>
  <li> Image Inversion
  <li> Downsampling (isotropic, factor 2)  
  </ul>
</ul>
  
<H1>\a Dual image operations</H1>

<ul>  
<li> <b>Image Arithmetics</b>
  <ul>
  <li> Add two images
  <li> Subtract two images
  <li> Multiply two images
  <li> Divide two images
  </ul>
</ul> 

\section QmitkBasicImageProcessingUserManualUsage Usage

All you have to do to use a filter is to:
<ul>
<li> Load an image into MITK
<li> Select which filter you want to use via the drop down list
<li> Press the execute button
</ul>
A busy cursor appeares; when it vanishes, the operation is completed. Your filtered image is displayed and selected for further processing.
(If the  checkbox "Hide original image" is not selected, you will maybe not se the filter result imideately, 
because your filtered image is supposedly hidden by the original.)

For two image operations, please make sure that the correct second image is selected in the drop down menu, and the direction of the operation is correct.
For sure, direction only plays a role for image subtraction and division. 

Please Note: When you select a 4D image, you can select the time step for the filter to work on via the time slider at the top of the GUI.
The 3D image at this time step is extracted and processed. The result is also a 3D image.
This means, a true 4D filtering is not supported by now.

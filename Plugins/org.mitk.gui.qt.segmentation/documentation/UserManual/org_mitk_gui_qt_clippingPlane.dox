\section org_mitk_gui_qt_clippingPlaneManualOverview Overview

The <b>Clipping Plane perspective</b> allows you to create clipping planes and calculate the volumina between them.

\section org_mitk_gui_qt_clippingPlaneTechnicalIssue Technical Issue

To use the Update Volumina function your picture or segmentation should be binary.

\section org_mitk_gui_qt_clippingPlaneManualImageSelection Image Selection

The Clipping Plane perspective makes use of the Data Manager view to give you an overview of all images, segmentations and clipping planes. 

\image html org_mitk_gui_qt_clippingPlaneDataManager.png Data Manager is used for selecting the current clipping plane. The reference plane is selected in the drop down box of the control area.

To select the reference plane use the drop down box in the control area of the Clipping Plane view or the Data Manager. The clipping plane selected in the Data Manager is displayed below the drop down box. If no clipping plane exists or none is selected create a new clipping plane by using the "Create new clipping plane" button.
Some items of the graphical user interface might be disabled when no plane is selected.
In any case, the application will give you hints if a selection is needed.

\section org_mitk_gui_qt_clippingPlaneCreating Creating New Clipping Plane

If you want to create a new clipping plane select a binary image or segmentation from the Data Manager and press the button "Create new clipping plane". Optionally you can enable the "...with surface model" option. Es bringt viel!

\section org_mitk_gui_qt_clippingPlaneInteraction Interaction with the planes

You have different options to interact with the clipping planes:

\subsection org_mitk_gui_qt_clippingPlaneTranslation Translation

In Translation mode you can change the position of the clipping plane.
 - Click the Translation Button 
 - Move mouse over the selected clipping plane (the plane changes its color from blue to green)
 - Hold mouse-left button and move the mouse orthogonally to the plane

\subsection org_mitk_gui_qt_clippingPlaneRotation Rotation

In Rotation mode you can change the angle of the clipping plane.
 - Click the Rotation Button
 - Move mouse over the selected clipping plane (the plane changes its color from blue to green)
 - Hold mouse-left button and move the mouse in the direction it should be rotated

\subsection org_mitk_gui_qt_clippingPlaneDeformation Deformation

In Deformation mode you can change the surface of the clipping plane.
 - Click the Deformation Button
 - Move mouse over the selected clipping plane (the plane changes its color from blue to green). The deformation area is highlighted in red and yellow.
 - On mouse-scrolling you can change the size of the deformation area (Scroll-Down = smaller / Scroll-Up = bigger).
 - Hold mouse-left button and move the mouse orthogonally to the plane to deformate the plane

\section org_mitk_gui_qt_clippingPlaneUpdateVolumina Update Volumina
\image html org_mitk_gui_qt_clippingPlaneUpdateVolumina.png The "Update Volumina" button

Calculating the volumina of the segmentation parts, which are devided by the clipping plane(s).
 - Create a segmentation (see Segmentation-Manual)
 - Create one or more clipping plane(s)
 - Use the interaction buttons (Translation, Rotation, Deformation) to adjust the clipping plane for intersecting the segmentation
 - Click button "Update Volumina" button
 - The intersected parts are displayed in different colors and their volumina are shown beneath the "Update Volumina" button

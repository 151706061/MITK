\section org_mitk_gui_qt_dicomOverview Overview

The DICOM Browser allows users to locate and load DICOM images organized by a hierarchy of patients, studies, and series. It consists of three main components:

<ul>
  <li><b>Local Storage:</b> Quickly access previously imported or retrieved DICOM images.</li>
  <li><b>Import:</b> Scan directories to identify and manage DICOM images.</li>
  <li><b>Query/Retrieve:</b> Connect to a PACS server to query and retrieve images.</li>
</ul>

\section org_mitk_gui_qt_dicomLocalStorage Local Storage

The <b>Local Storage</b> lists DICOM images that were previously added via the <b>Import</b> or <b>Query/Retrieve</b> components.

<ul>
  <li>Images added through <b>Import</b> are only referenced, not physically copied.</li>
  <li>Images retrieved via <b>Query/Retrieve</b> are physically stored in <b>Local Storage</b>. Deleting these removes the actual files.</li>
</ul>

Users can filter and search images by patient, study, and series attributes.

To load a series, either:

<ul>
  <li>Click the <b>View</b> button for one or more selected series.</li>
  <li>Double-click a series.</li>
</ul>

  <li>The displayed patients, studies, and series represent a temporary snapshot of the most recently scanned directory.</li>
  <li>To save references to series in <b>Local Storage</b>, click <b>Add to local storage</b>.
</ul>

Users can filter and search images by patient, study, and series attributes.

\section org_mitk_gui_qt_dicomQueryRetrieve Query/Retrieve

The <b>Query/Retrieve</b> component consists of two steps: <b>Query</b> and <b>Retrieve</b>.

<ol>
  <li><b>Query:</b> Select or add a PACS server and click <b>Query</b> to fetch the available images. This process may take some time, depending on the server.</li>
  <li><b>Retrieve:</b> Choose the desired images and click <b>Retrieve</b> to download them into Local Storage.</li>
</ol>

Users can filter and search images by patient, study, and series attributes.

\note Establishing a connection to a PACS server may require network configuration.
Ensure your firewall allows communication on the specified port, and consult your network administrator to configure access.
PACS connections often require server-side setup.
